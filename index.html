     <p>Susan Villatoro is a determined individual, who has dedicated the past twelve years to breaking the generational cycle of abuse and neglect within families. What she lacks in size she makes up for in personality. Her positive attitude and creative way of thinking leads to quickly building rapport with her clients, allowing the client to feel supported as they venture on a new journey.</p><p>When she is not working, Susan volunteers her time with different animal, arts, and LGBT organizations. She believes that every person and animal should have the opportunity to thrive. Susan also enjoys binge watching YouTube Videos whenever possible and lives by the motto “DFTBA” (Don’t Forget to Be Awesome), which she learned from her favorite YouTubers, vlogbrothers.</p>
